    services:
      - name: Trauma
        slug: /trauma
        examples: >
          * Acute Trauma: Results from a single event

          * Chronic Trauma: Results from repeated and prolonged exposure to
          highly stressful events

          * Complex Trauma: Results from exposure to multiple and varied
          traumatic events, often of an invasive, interpersonal nature, and
          having wide-ranging, long-term effects.
        description: >
          **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)**

          TF-CBT is a components-based model that integrates trauma-sensitive
          interventions with cognitive-behavioral principles. The theory is that
          by addressing distorted thoughts and beliefs related to the trauma and
          gradually exposing the individual to the traumatic memory in a safe
          environment, the associated negative emotions and maladaptive
          behaviors can be reduced
      - name: Depression
        slug: /services/depression
        examples: >
          * Persistent low mood, sadness, or a feeling of emptiness.

          * Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed.

          * Significant changes in appetite or sleep patterns.

          * Constant fatigue and lack of energy.

          * Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or feelings of
          worthlessness.

          * Unexplained physical aches and pains.
        description: >
          Treatment typically involves psychotherapy, medication, or a
          combination of both. Therapeutic approaches like Cognitive Behavioral
          Therapy (CBT) focus on identifying and modifying negative thought
          patterns and behaviors. The goal is to develop healthy coping
          strategies, process underlying emotions, and restore a sense of
          well-being and function.
      - name: Anxiety
        slug: /services/anxiety
        examples: >
          * Excessive, persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.

          * Sudden, intense episodes of fear known as panic attacks.

          * Physical symptoms like a racing heart, sweating, trembling, and
          shortness of breath.

          * Avoidance of places or situations that trigger anxious feelings.

          * Feeling restless, on-edge, or easily fatigued.
        description: >
          Effective treatment often combines therapy with skill-building.
          Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is highly effective, helping
          individuals challenge irrational fears and thought patterns. A key
          component is often exposure therapy, which involves gradually and
          safely confronting feared situations to reduce avoidance. Treatment
          focuses on learning relaxation techniques and coping mechanisms to
          manage physical symptoms and regain a sense of control.
      - name: Stress & Burnout
        slug: /services/stress
        examples: >
          * Feelings of energy depletion or emotional and physical exhaustion.

          * Increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of cynicism
          and negativity related to it.

          * A sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.

          * Physical symptoms like headaches, stomach issues, and sleep
          disturbances.

          * Irritability, difficulty concentrating, and loss of motivation.
        description: >
          Treatment focuses on identifying sources of stress and developing
          practical strategies for management. This includes learning to set
          firm boundaries (e.g., saying "no," disconnecting from work),
          improving time management, and prioritizing self-care. The goal is to
          implement restorative practices like mindfulness, exercise, and
          adequate sleep to replenish physical and emotional energy and create a
          more sustainable work-life balance.
      - name: Anger Management
        slug: /services/anger-management
        examples: >
          * Frequent, intense outbursts of anger that feel uncontrollable.

          * Physical aggression, such as hitting walls or becoming physically
          confrontational.

          * Chronic irritability, impatience, and frustration.

          * Engaging in threatening or intimidating behavior.

          * Experiencing negative consequences in relationships or at work due
          to anger.
        description: >
          Treatment is a proactive process focused on skill development. It
          involves identifying the triggers and underlying reasons for anger.
          Individuals learn emotional regulation techniques to calm down in the
          moment and cognitive restructuring to change thought patterns that
          lead to rage. The core goal is to develop healthier communication
          skills and constructive problem-solving strategies to express feelings
          and needs effectively without resorting to destructive anger.
      - name: Children's Therapy
        slug: /services/child-therapy
        examples: >
          * Significant changes in mood, like unusual sadness, anxiety, or
          irritability.

          * Sudden behavioral shifts, such as increased aggression, tantrums, or
          acting out at school or home.

          * Difficulty making or keeping friends, social withdrawal, or
          challenges with cooperation.

          * Struggling to cope with major life events like a family divorce, a
          move, or the loss of a loved one.

          * Expressing feelings of low self-worth, persistent worry, or
          displaying a sharp decline in academic performance.
        description: >
          Children's therapy is tailored to the child's developmental stage and
          unique personality. Instead of just talk therapy, counselors use a
          child's natural language: play. Through activities like drawing, using
          puppets, playing with sand trays, and board games, children can safely
          express feelings and work through challenges they don't have the words
          for. The therapist creates a safe, supportive space for the child to
          build coping skills, enhance self-esteem, and learn to manage big
          emotions. Treatment is collaborative and often involves parents to
          ensure support continues at home.
