          The darkness felt absolute, a weight I thought would never lift. But
          step by tiny step, with the right support and a fierce commitment to
          healing, I found my way back to the light.

          My therapist helped me slowly find glimmers of hope and reconnect with
          parts of myself I thought were lost forever. I'm not 'cured,' but I
          have joy, purpose, and the strength to keep moving forward. It's been
          life-changing.

          It wasn't easy work, but the difference is incredible. My
          relationships are healthier, more open, and I feel so much more
          connected to the people I love.
